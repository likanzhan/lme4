## Recent/release notes

* Version 1.1-19 is on CRAN (November 2019). Changes in this release are fairly minor: the biggest changes are that a message is now printed for singular fits. See the [NEWS file](https://github.com/lme4/lme4/blob/master/inst/NEWS.Rd) (or  `news(Version=="1.1.19",package="lme4")`).

## Where to get help

- `r-sig-mixed-models@r-project.org` for questions about `lme4` usage and more general mixed model questions
- https://github.com/lme4/lme4/issues for bug, infelicity, and wishlist reporting
- The [lme4 tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lme4) for programming-related or the [lme4-nlme tag on CrossValidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lme4-nlme) for statistics-related questions
- maintainer e-mail only for urgent/private communications

## Support

If you choose to support `lme4` development financially, you can contribute to a fund at McMaster University (home institution of one of the developers) [here](https://secureca.imodules.com/s/1439/17/giving/form.aspx?sid=1439&gid=1&pgid=770&cid=1618&dids=2413&bledit=1&appealcode=18C9). The form will say that you are donating to the "Global Coding Fund"; this fund is available for use by the developers, under McMaster's research spending rules. We plan to use the funds, as available, to pay students to do maintenance and development work. There is no way to earmark funds or set up a bounty to direct funding toward particular features, but you can e-mail the maintainers and suggest priorities for your donation.

## Features

* Efficient for large data sets, using algorithms from the
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
linear algebra package via the [RcppEigen](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppEigen)
interface layer.
* Allows arbitrarily many nested and crossed random effects.
* Fits generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and nonlinear mixed models (NLMMs) via Laplace approximation
or adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature; GLMMs allow user-defined families and link functions.
* Incorporates likelihood profiling and parametric bootstrapping.

## Installation

### On current R (>= 3.0.0)

* From CRAN (stable release 1.0.+)
* Development version from Github:
```
library("devtools"); install_github("lme4/lme4",dependencies=TRUE)
```
(This requires `devtools` >= 1.6.1, and installs the "master" (development) branch.)
This approach builds the package from source, i.e. `make` and compilers must be installed on your system -- see the R FAQ for your operating system; you may also need to install dependencies manually. Specify `build_vignettes=FALSE` if you have trouble because your system is missing some of the `LaTeX/texi2dvi` tools.
* Development binaries from `lme4` r-forge repository:
```
install.packages("lme4",
   repos=c("http://lme4.r-forge.r-project.org/repos",
          getOption("repos")[["CRAN"]]))
```
(these source and binary versions are updated manually, so may be out of date; if you believe they are, please contact the maintainers).

### On old R (pre-3.0.0)

It is possible to install (but not easily to check) `lme4` at least as recently as 1.1-7.

* make sure you have *exactly* these package versions: `Rcpp` 0.10.5, `RcppEigen` 3.2.0.2
* for installation, use `--no-inst`; this is necessary in order to prevent R from getting hung up by the `knitr`-based vignettes
* running `R CMD check` is difficult, but possible if you hand-copy the contents of the `inst` directory into the installed package directory ...

### Of `lme4.0`

* `lme4.0` is a maintained version of lme4 back compatible to CRAN versions of lme4 0.99xy,
  mainly for the purpose of  *reproducible research and data analysis* which was done with 0.99xy versions of lme4.
* there have been [some](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23662589/r-reverting-to-lme4-0-and-still-getting-inconsistent-results) [reports](http://hlplab.wordpress.com/2014/06/24/more-on-old-and-new-lme4/) of problems with `lme4.0` on R version 3.1; if someone has a specific reproducible example they'd like to donate, please contact the maintainers.
* Notably, `lme4.0` features  `getME(<mod>, "..")` which is compatible (as much as sensibly possible) with the current `lme4`'s version of `getME()`.
* You can use the `convert_old_lme4()` function to take a fitted object created with `lme4` <1.0 and convert it for use with `lme4.0`.
* It currently resides on R-forge, and you should be able to install it with
```
install.packages("lme4.0",
                 repos=c("http://lme4.r-forge.r-project.org/repos",
                         getOption("repos")[["CRAN"]]))
```
(if the binary versions are out of date or unavailable for your system, please contact the maintainers).
